    <em>BOOKS ADVANTAGES</em>
 </h1>

<p> Reading is important because it develops our thoughts, gives us 
 endless knowledge and lessons, while keeping our mind active. Books can contain 
 and store all sorts of information, stories, thoughts and feelings unlike anything else in
  this world. The importance of a book that helps us learn and understand things cannot be 
  underestimated.</p> 
  
  <p> The benefits of reading books are obvious. Books
     broaden the horizons of a person, enrich his inner world, make him smarter. 
     And it is also important to read books because it increases the vocabulary of a 
     person, develops a clear and precise thinking. A person who reads speaks better.</p>

     <p>Books help to learn something new, keep up the conversation 
        or show off erudition in the company. But the writers themselves see in l
        iterature and non-obvious bonuses. A reader rarely feels lonely, with the help of a 
        good story he can quickly escape from depressing thoughts, better understand the world 
        and the people around him.</p>

            <em> BOOK TYPES </em>
        </h1>

      <p> Each book published by the author is unique. And yet any book can be 
        attributed to a certain type. There are several such types and it is 
        necessary to know them, because the UDC and LBC classification indices are built on them, 
        which must be used when publishing a book. These indexes play an extremely important role,
         because with their help books are placed on the shelves of shops and libraries. 
         Let's take a closer look at them.</p>
        
         <p> According to their social purpose, books are divided into educational, 
        popular science, scientific, reference, and fiction. By the nature of their content, 
        they can be divided into historical, mathematical, biological, philosophical, 
        art history, universal and diversified. According to the reader's address, 
        books are divided into two groups - for an adult reader and for children.</p>
         
        <p> The publication of a book included in the first group, 
         intended for adults, is divided into those
         addressed to: the general reader, i.e., practically for any person who can read; for 
         a wide range of readers - a narrower group compared to the first, limited by some 
         criteria, for example, by age - youth or pensioners, by education - secondary or higher,
          by interest in a particular topic - cinema or theater; to a narrow circle of 
          readers - the smallest group, united by belonging to the specifics of one topic.</p> 
          
          <p> According to the number of readers in each of these groups, books can be mass, 
          popular or narrowly grouped. The reader's address for children can also be divided 
          into several subspecies: up to six years old inclusive - younger and older 
          preschoolers; from seven to ten years old - younger schoolchildren; from eleven 
          to fourteen years old - middle-aged schoolchildren; and older schoolchildren - from 
          fifteen to seventeen years. The internal structure of the published book is disclosed 
          in this article.</p>
